                1. Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon
                A.A. unity.</br>
                2. For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority—a loving God as
                He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but
                trusted servants; they do not govern.</br>
                3. The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking.</br>
                4. Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups
                or A.A. as a whole.</br>
                5. Each group has but one primary purpose—to carry its message to the
                alcoholic who still suffers.</br>
                6. An A.A. group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the A.A. name to any
                related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property, and
                prestige divert us from our primary purpose.</br>
                7. Every A.A. group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside
                contributions.</br>
                8. Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional, but our
                service centers may employ special workers.</br>
                9. A.A., as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards
                or committees directly responsible to those they serve.</br>
                10. Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the A.A.
                name ought never be drawn into public controversy.</br>
                11. Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we
                need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio, and
                films.</br>
                12. Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions, ever reminding us
                to place principles before personalities</br></br>
