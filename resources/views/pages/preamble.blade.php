                    Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.</br></br>
                    The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for A.A. membership; we are self-supporting through our own contributions. A.A. is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy; neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.

                <p class="card-text py-2">
                    The Preamble first appeared in the Grapevine in June 1947, and was written by Tom Y., the Grapevine editor at that time. The aim was to offer a concise definition of A.A. Shortly thereafter, the Preamble began appearing in each monthly is- sue of the Grapevine, and later on in much of our A.A. Conference-approved literature.</br></br>
                    It came to be called the preamble because it is so often read at the opening of A.A. meetings.</br></br>
                    The original version of the Preamble contained the word- ing, “an honest desire to stop drinking.” However, since the adoption of the short form of the Traditions in 1950, the Third Tradition has always read, “The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking” and this form was used by Bill in writing the book, Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions.</br></br>
                    In 1958 the expression “honest desire” was discussed at great length at the General Service Conference. It was felt that it was impossible to determine what constitutes an “hon- est” desire to stop drinking, thus the word was dropped. The version of the Preamble without the word “honest” first ap- peared in the September 1958 issue of the Grapevine.</br></br>
                    There have been other versions of the Preamble, written by A.A. members for their local groups’ use, which were then cir- culated around A.A.; for example: the “Texas Preamble,” the “Wilmington Preamble,” etc. Many A.A.
                    members find these interesting, though they
                    have never been adopted by the Fellowship as
                    a whole.</br></br>
